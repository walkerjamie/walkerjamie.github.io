Personal Statement: James Walker
My Background

Here's my first paragraph. I'm a teacher of web development and an application developer and system administrator in the Center for Teaching Excellence at BC.

My Extra-Curricular  Interests, Sports or Hobbies
I am a nature lover and naturalist. I love geology, paleontology, anthropology, astronomy and quantum physics. I am also a musician, singer/songwriter/guitarist who has spent way too many years playing in nightclubs! I love skiing, hiking and traveling.

My Interest in Web Development

I became interested in IT as a geologist with the potential of digital mapping and geographic data profiling. I became more interested in the web after working as a CD ROM application developer in the 90's when that technology became obsolete.



What I Hope to Gain from this Course

My goal is to help my students learn something about HTML, web development, the nature of the internet, and some of the ways that the internet affects our lives.


Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About

I would like to catch up on html5 and learn more javascript. Maybe I can learn how to make myself less vulnerable to predatory marketers and other suspicious characters.
