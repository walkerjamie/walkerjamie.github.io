<p>"This is the story of Queen more than it is of its frontman. It begins in 1970 with Freddie (Rami Malek), a flamboyant youth with a mouth full of too many teeth and too many notes, meeting Smile, a beige rock band that would become Queen through the power of Mercury’s charisma. It ends with Queen’s performance at Live Aid in 1985. The Freddie Mercury story would carry on for another six, very important years, but Bohemian Rhapsody is content to leave those to a brief, written pre-credits summary."</p>
<p>"However, the film has a secret weapon, firing off all over the place to try and blast the movie out of its gentility: Rami Malek. As Mercury he is spectacular. A strutting, flamboyant peacock among pigeons on stage; a party waiting to happen and too scared to leave it. There are other lights in the cast — Ben Hardy is a lot of fun as Roger Taylor — but Malek outshines them all, giving the material a wallop it needs. In the final sequence, which recreates Live Aid with a visual excitement lacking elsewhere, Malek wrings every second he has left, performing like it might be Freddie’s last time, and it’s very affecting. If the script hits a lot of bum notes, Malek is always perfectly in key."</p>
