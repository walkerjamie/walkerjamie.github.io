<h1>Personal Statement: James Walker</h1><p><strong>My Background</strong></p>	<p>Here's my first paragraph. I'm a teacher of web development and an application developer and system administrator in the Center for Teaching Excellence at BC.</p><h2>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies</h2>	<p>I am a nature lover and naturalist. I love geology, paleontology, anthropology, astronomy and quantum physics.<br> I am also a musician, singer/songwriter/guitarist who has spent way too many years playing in nightclubs! I love skiing, hiking and traveling.</p><p><strong>My Interest in Web Development</strong></p>	<p>I became interested in IT as a geologist with the potential of digital mapping and geographic data profiling. I became more interested in the web after working as a CD ROM application developer in the 90's when that technology became obsolete.</p><p><strong>What I Hope to Gain from this Course</strong></p>	<p>My goal is to help my students learn something about HTML, web development, the nature of the internet, and some of the ways that the internet affects our lives.</p><p><strong>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About</strong></p>	<p>I would like to catch up on html5 and learn more javascript. Maybe I can learn how to make myself less vulnerable to predatory marketers and other suspicious characters.</p>
