Speaking of not displaying in the browser, the following <head></head> tag pair, a new one for your html template,
is in every html document, just like the <body></body> tags, but is a separate element that precedes the body tag
and contains meta-data that is communicated to, but not displayed by, the browser. We will be making good use of it
but for now it contains two child tag pairs: <title></title> and the <meta> tag.
The <meta> tag also has an 'attribute' called 'charset' which has a value of 'utf8'---
